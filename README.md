# ampcast-themes

This is a collection of themes I edited for personal use with the [Ampcast](https://github.com/rekkyrosso/ampcast) music player (an awesome project).

You can check screenshots of the themes in `Screenshots`, while the themes themselves are found in `Themes`.

## Usage
Clone the repository, or download the .json files.

In Ampcast, Go to `Settings -> Appearance -> My Themes -> Import` and select the .json files.

After importing they will be available on the `My Themes` section on `Settings -> Appearance -> General`.

Feel free to modify and/or suggest other themes! =)
